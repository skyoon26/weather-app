# **Weather App** 🌦️

This is a simple weather application built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The app allows users to search for the current weather conditions of any city by fetching data from a weather API. It displays the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an image representing the weather conditions (e.g. sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.).

I created this project to gain hands-on practice with accessing data from a public API. While following an online tutorial, I added personal features to make the app more unique and user-friendly.

## **Features** ✨
* Search for the weather by city name: Users can search via a mouse click or the Enter key.
* Current weather details: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.
* Unit toggle: Switch between metric (°C, km/h) and imperial (°F, mph) units of measurement.
* Easy-to-use interface: Designed to work well on both mobile and desktop devices.

## **Technologies Used** 🛠️
* JavaScript: Fetching data from a weather API.
* HTML5: Structuring the application.
* CSS3: Styling and responsiveness.
* [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api): Public weather data API.
